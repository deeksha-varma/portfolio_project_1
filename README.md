#### Future Additions

### Surface

The design of the website focuses on depicting a _playful_ and _vibrant_ color theme.
The visual image of donut with sprinkles is used as part of the logo branding.
A background image of donut is used to grab visual attention of the user while also adding a touch of charm and playfulness to the design.
Call-to-action button on the home page is used to establish a visual hierarchy to guide users' attention towards important elements such as the Menu page.
A combination of playful and modern fonts that add personality to the design while ensuring readability were chosen.

#### Color Scheme

The color scheme chosen needs to evoke a sense of playfulness, warmth, and deliciousness. With this idea in mind, a combination of bright and vibrant colors were used to capture attention and reflect the fun and joyful nature of donut indulgence.
The highlight on the homepage is the hero image. A neutral base, such as a light cream is paired with a pop of hot pink on the other pages. This approach allows the colorful elements, like illustrations or images, to stand out while maintaining an overall clean and modern look.

![Color Scheme](documentation/color_scheme.png)

#### Font

'Lily Script One' is the font used for logo (the business name), text in the main body of the site and lowerlevel headings use 'Roboto Slab' font.

1. **Roboto Slab** is a clean and modern serif font that provides excellent readability. It has a straightforward and professional appearance, making it suitable for body text and general content.

2. **Lily Script One** is a handwritten script font with a playful and whimsical feel. Its flowing and casual letterforms add a touch of personality and creativity to logos, or decorative elements. Therefore aligning well with the delightful and handmade nature of Oh Nuts! Donuts.
